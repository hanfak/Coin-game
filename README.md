#Coin flipping game

This is a game I created following an online tutorial given by Derek Banas on his YouTube video channel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BVXQ64wI00&list=PLGLfVvz_LVvS5P7khyR4xDp7T9lCk9PgE&index=2

The game was used as an example to teach how to design programs using UML and the game was written in Java.

I made my own version using the tutorial and converted it into Ruby, and added user input so the player can choose what side of the coin
to pick. 

Aim was to learn more about programming with object oriented ideas, sending messages to objects, using multiple classes, creating objects
in other classes, basics of ruby programming.

Next I will develop a similar game using dice.

To run the game, download to local and run the "coinFlipplingGame.rb" and follow the instructions.

Enjoy.
